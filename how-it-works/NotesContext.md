# Notes Context

## Overview
The NotesContext is a React context that manages the state and operations for the Notes functionality across the application. It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes, as well as synchronizing with the database.

## File Location
`src/tools/Notes/NotesContext.tsx`

## Key Functionality

### Note Management
- Fetch all notes for the current user
- Create new notes
- Update existing notes
- Delete notes
- Search and filter notes

### Data Structure
Each note typically contains:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Note title
- `content`: Note body text
- `createdAt`: Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt`: Last modification timestamp
- `userId`: Owner of the note

### State Management
The context maintains several pieces of state:
- `notes`: Array of all user notes
- `isLoading`: Boolean indicating if notes are being fetched
- `error`: Any error that occurred during operations
- `selectedNote`: Currently selected note for viewing/editing

## Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Uses Supabase for data storage and retrieval
- Implements real-time subscription for live updates
- Handles offline/online synchronization

### Authentication Integration
- Connects with AuthContext to get the current user
- Ensures notes are associated with the correct user
- Implements permission checks for note operations

### Optimization Techniques
- Implements caching for better performance
- Uses optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Debounces save operations to prevent excessive database calls

## Context Provider
- Wraps the application (or relevant parts) to provide notes functionality
- Initializes by fetching notes from the database
- Manages the notes state throughout the application lifecycle

## Context Consumer
Components can consume this context to:
- Access the list of notes
- Perform CRUD operations on notes
- Get the loading and error states

## Usage Example

```jsx
// Inside a component
import { useNotes } from '../tools/Notes/NotesContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    notes, 
    isLoading, 
    createNote, 
    updateNote, 
    deleteNote, 
    selectedNote,
    selectNote
  } = useNotes();
  
  const handleCreateNote = () => {
    createNote({ title: 'New Note', content: 'Note content' });
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCreateNote}>Create New Note</button>
      
      {isLoading ? (
        <p>Loading notes...</p>
      ) : (
        <ul>
          {notes.map(note => (
            <li key={note.id} onClick={() => selectNote(note)}>
              <h3>{note.title}</h3>
              <p>{note.content.substring(0, 50)}...</p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      
      {selectedNote && (
        <div>
          <h2>{selectedNote.title}</h2>
          <p>{selectedNote.content}</p>
          <button onClick={() => deleteNote(selectedNote.id)}>Delete</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Extensibility
The NotesContext is designed to be extensible for future features:
- Note categories and tags
- Note sharing between users
- Advanced search capabilities
- Note templates
- Export/import functionality
