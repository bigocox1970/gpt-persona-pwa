# Tools Page

## Overview
The Tools Page serves as a hub for accessing various utility features within the application, such as Notes and Todos. It provides a centralized location for users to access productivity tools that complement the chat experience.

## File Location
`src/tools/ToolsPage.tsx`

## Key Components

### Tool Cards
- Visual cards representing each available tool
- Each card includes an icon, title, and brief description
- Cards are clickable to navigate to the respective tool

### Navigation
- Links to individual tool pages
- Back navigation to return to the main application
- Consistent header with app branding

## Available Tools

### Notes
- Quick access to the Notes feature
- Displays a preview of recent notes (if applicable)
- Links to the full Notes page

### Todos
- Access to the Todo list functionality
- May show a count of pending tasks
- Links to the full Todos page

## Implementation Details

### Routing
- Uses React Router for navigation between tools
- Maintains navigation history for back functionality
- Preserves tool state when navigating away and back

### Layout
- Responsive grid layout for tool cards
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Maintains consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

### State Management
- May track recently used tools
- Could store tool-specific preferences
- Potentially synchronizes with user settings

## Integration Points
- Connected to the main application navigation
- May share data with the chat functionality
- Integrates with individual tool contexts (NotesContext, TodosContext)

## Future Extensibility
The Tools Page is designed to be easily extensible for adding new tools:
- Calendar/scheduling tools
- File storage/sharing
- Knowledge base/wiki
- Custom user-created tools

## Usage
Users can access the Tools Page from the main navigation menu, then select a specific tool to use. Each tool opens in its own dedicated page while maintaining the overall application context and navigation structure.
